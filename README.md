![Board Image](http://cdn.kouno.xyz/lMvMEt9R.png)
## Notes:

 - Currently untested!
 - Designed for handsoldering, BOM contains parts that are "extended" on JLC, or straight up not present
 - CPL file not tested at all
 - See "Outputs/" for production files
 - IMUs that are compatible :
 - - BMI160
 - - BMI270
 - - BMI323(?)
 - - LSM6DSV
 - - LSM6DSV16X
 - - ICM-40608
 - - Potentially more, but there will be no firmware support, even for some of the ones listed above
 - Special thanks to Gorbit99 and wigwagwent for their help with making this <3
